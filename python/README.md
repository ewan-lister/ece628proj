In order to simulate the handshake with server and two clients type the following commands.

In one terminal: `python server1.py`

In another terminal:`python client1.py` (RSA Client)

In yet another terminal: `python client2.py` (DHE Client)

The server and client logs should show them performing their respective handshake messages and then closing.
